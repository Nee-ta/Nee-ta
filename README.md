Going forward on EVERYTHING ðŸ¤£
I work fulltime, volunteer in different areas and take tons of courses in various fields. I am all over the map...I do not have a specific field. I have chosen general knowledge in many different areas, which provides me with the ability to interact and be involved with everyone, everywhere, in every sector, regardless of age, race, nationality, gender or social economic status. I am working on my leadership skills, among other things. I use my positive attitude to encourage and strengthen others to be their authentic self, do their best, progress not perfection, learn, grow and DO. To be strong, go forward, be kind, thoughtful, helpful and be supportive.
 I love learning & technology.
